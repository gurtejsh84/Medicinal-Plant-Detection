# Welcome to the Medicinal Plant Detection Project repository! <br>

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to identify and classify medicinal plants from images.<br>
The goal is to aid botanists, herbalists, and researchers in accurately identifying medicinal plants for various purposes, such as herbal medicine production and conservation efforts.<br>

# Features<br>

* Plant Species Classification: The model can classify images of plant leaves into different medicinal plant species.<br>
* High Accuracy: The model achieves high accuracy in plant species identification, enabling reliable detection of medicinal plants.<br>
* User-Friendly Interface: The project includes a user-friendly interface for uploading plant leaf images and obtaining species classification results.<br>
* Fast Processing: The prediction process is fast, allowing for quick analysis of large datasets of plant images.<br>

# Usage <br>
To use the medicinal plant detection model, follow these steps:<br>

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.<br>
2. Install the required dependencies specified in the model.<br>
3. Launch the application by running python notebook in jupyter notebbok.<br>
4. Upload an image of a plant leaf to the application.<br>
5. View the predicted medicinal plant species for the uploaded image.<br>

# Dataset <br>
The project utilizes a publicly available dataset of plant leaf images annotated with species labels.<br> 
The dataset includes images of various medicinal plant species, along with their corresponding labels.<br> 
Proper attribution and citation of the dataset source are provided in the project documentation.<br>
